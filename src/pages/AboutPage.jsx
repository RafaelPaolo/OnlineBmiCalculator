      <h2>Know your BMI</h2>
      <p>
        Knowing your BMI is important for several reasons. It is an approximate
        measure of your total body fat and can help you determine if you are at
        a healthy weight. Being underweight or overweight can cause health
        problems, especially if you are also inactive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your BMI is a measurement that is a ratio of your weight and height.
        It’s a good way to gauge whether your weight is in healthy proportion to
        your height. In fact, knowing your BMI can help you – and your doctor –
        determine any health risks you may face if it’s outside of the healthy
        range.
      </p>
      <p>
        The value of BMI is used to understand whether an individual is at a
        healthy weight, underweight, overweight or obese. Being obese can
        increase health risks significantly, hence BMI is an easy way and a
        non-invasive measure that will help you to keep track of your weight in
        relation to your height.
